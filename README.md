# dyn-array

`dyn-array` is a fork of [dynamicarray](https://github.com/gustavopezzi/dynamicarray) by Gustavo Pezzi ([gustavopezzi](https://github.com/gustavopezzi)), which in turn is a fork of [darray.h](https://github.com/zauonlok/renderer/blob/master/renderer/core/darray.h) and [darray.c](https://github.com/zauonlok/renderer/blob/master/renderer/core/darray.c) by [zauonlok](https://github.com/zauonlok).

The license remains the same (MIT).

`dyn-array` updates the interface slightly to be similar to that of `std::vector` in C++. Tests have also been added.
